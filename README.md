* ### Labs
All the labs have achieved a perfect score.
* ### Final Project
Achieving a ***7.25Ã— speedup*** in computation without compromising accuracy.

Areas for improvement
---
>Lab 5

1. Transmit two pieces of data to the CFU's BRAM at once. Perform the counter operations within the circuit instead of transmitting the data separately. This can achieve faster results.
2. Reduce the initialization time for the im2col matrix.

>Final Project

1. The circuit synthesis took too long, and the overall circuit design has not yet been optimized.
