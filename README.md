Labs Spec: (https://nycu-caslab.github.io/AAML2024/ "Labs Spec")

All the labs have achieved a perfect score.

Areas for improvement:
Lab 5 -
1. Transmit two pieces of data to the CFU's BRAM at once. Perform the counter operations within the circuit instead of transmitting the data separately. This can achieve faster results.
2. Reduce the initialization time for the im2col matrix.
